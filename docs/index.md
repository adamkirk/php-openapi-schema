# PHP OpenApi Schema

This package aims to be an OOP representation of an Open API schema for php, to help build schemas programmatically.

## tl;dr

- Provides a `Document` class that can be modified to add various attributes for OpenApi schemas
- Supports marshalling the object to JSON
- Currently supports openapi **3.1** explicitly (although it may work for others, it hasn't been tested)
- Tested with php **8.0** and above
